Hi, I'm Abri Grobler

I am a web developer, mostly front end, with expertise in React, vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. I am also working on a portfolio, which will enable me to
freelance more frequently.

I am also a student working towards my Master's Degree in Engineering, in which I am focussing on Reinforcement Learning,
specifically in the areas of multi agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and the options framework.
